# PyBer Ride-Sharing Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create various visualizations for the PyBer CEO. The data was grouped by city type and various fare, driver and ride related metrics were graphed using scatter plots, pie charts, box & whisker plots, and line graphs. 

## Results
The charts below are two examples from the analysis that was performed for PyBer's CEO. As you can see the data clearly varies by city type, with no overlap. Urban cities have a lot more drivers, rides, and total fares, however the average fare per ride and per driver are lower than the suburban and rural city types.  Rural cities have the fewest rides, drivers and total fares, and their average fare per ride and driver are both higher than both suburban and urban city types.  Suburban cities fall in between the urban and rural city types in all categories.

## Summary
Based on the results of the PyBer analysis I would make the following recommendations to the PyBer CEO:
  1. Lower the fare prices in the rural cities and/or offer up promotional pricing for new riders.  This will promote an increase in ridership in these areas where the ride counts are low.

  2. Increase the fares in the urban cities. A small increase shouldn't drop ridership by a lot, and may incentivize new drivers to sign up.

  3. Do a more in depth analysis on the current PyBer data to identify correlations between the number of drivers & riders, look at ride turnaround times to see if there is a shortage of drivers causing lower ridership numbers, and identify peak ride times.  I would also suggest doing an ongoing analysis on the changes made from the above suggestions to make sure the outcomes match expectations.
